# Machine-Learning
This repository involves some basic Machine Learning Algorithms and their implementation in Python.
Please note that all the algorithms uploaded for KNN are based on datasets from sklearn.
They do not involve preprocessing and hence the data is used without any cleaning.
In practical approaches, the datasets need lots of preprocessing before feeding into an algorithm.
Also classifiers from sklearn are used.
